The PSDS is a metric for evaluating Sound Event Detection (SED) systems.
Differently from other widely adopted metrics, PSDS:
1. Introduces a new, flexible and robust definition of event detection that yields
an evaluation closer to the end-user perception of sound events
2. Discriminates cross-triggers from generic false positives and supports
their custom weighting to cope with imbalanced datasets and to help developers
identify weaknesses in the system
3. Evaluates the SED system performance using multiple operating points to truly
measure the quality of the sound event modelling without system calibration
bias

These capabilities are summarized below. For more details please
read the paper accessible from the link above.

1. **Definition of event detection**

   When evaluating SED system performance, existing metrics constrain the
   detection's start and end times to within a certain distance from
   the ground truth. This determines whether the detections are correct or
   not.
   An example of such a constraint is commonly called "collar". While it introduces
   some degree of tolerance for either human or system imperfections in the
   evaluation, it also increases the need for very accurate ground truths by
   requiring the detections to closely match the annotations. Suppose an audio
   sample contains two very close dog barks (e.g. 200ms) and the annotator
   decided to create two ground truths. A system that detects both annotations
   with a single detection should not be penalised.

   PSDS relaxes these constraints by introducing a flexible and more
   user-oriented definition of event detection. Two parameters, expressed as a
   percentage of intersection between two or more entities, are used: Detection
   Tolerance Criterion (DTC) and Ground Truth intersection Criterion (GTC).
   The image below shows how 5 typical scenarios are evaluated using collars
   (left) and using the PSDS method (right).
   The taller background rectangles are ground truths while the smaller
   foreground rectangles represent the system detections. Vertical dashed lines
   simulate how the ground truth boundaries are affected by the collar.

2. **Cross-triggers**

   Suppose we have a 3-class SED system that outputs 4 detections for a given
   audio sample with two sound events. The scenario is depicted in the figure
   below in which ground truths and detections are indicated by background and
   foreground rectangles, respectively.

   ![Fig: CT Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/audioanalytic/psds_eval/master/examples/data/ct_example.jpg)

   Detections 1 and 3 are clearly true positives (TP) while detections 2 and 4
   are false positives (FP). In addition to this, PSDS also counts detection 4
   as a cross-trigger (CT) for Class 3 on the ground truth Class 1.
   The confusion matrix for this example would be:

   |         | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3 | WORLD |
   | ------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---: |
   | Class 1 |    1    |         |         |   1   |
   | Class 2 |         |    1    |         |       |
   | Class 3 |    1    |         |         |   1   |

   PSDS also allows a custom weight to be applied to CTs in order to define
   their importance in the final evaluation. Such weighting can be crucial when
   the evaluation dataset is unbalanced. For instance, the sound of
   window glass breaking rarely happens in the real world, yet the reliable
   evaluation of glass breaking TPs requires a large number of positive class
   samples, which may in turn artificially increase the FP counts for other
   percussive classes. In such scenario, PSDS would help the developer to assess
   the system performance by weighting out the cross-trigger effects. It also
   helps to highlight the limits of the system and to narrow the problem down
   to, perhaps, a training labels problem.

3. **Operating point**

   Standard metrics for SED conflate the evaluation of sound event modelling
   with the evaluation of operating point (OP) tuning. In other fields of
   research, such as keyword spotting, this issue is solved by evaluating
   multiple operating points and by reporting an overall measure, such as area
   under curve. PSDS calculates the area under the Polyphonic Sound Detection
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (PSD-ROC).

   The image below shows an example of PSD-ROC for a SED system. The curve is
   built by choosing a number of different tunings (operating points) of the
   system. Let's consider the two points indicated by *A* (30, 0.3) and *B*
   (30, 0.39). If the system is tuned to *A*, the performance is underestimated
   given that for a similar false positive rate the system can achieve a
   significantly higher true positive rate if tuned to *B*.

   ![Fig: PSD ROC Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/audioanalytic/psds_eval/master/examples/data/psd_roc_2.png)

   An evaluation based on multiple OPs provides a better understanding of the
   system performance at different TP/FP trade-offs.

   Important note:

   * The PSD-ROC curve is a summary of the multiple outputs of the system under
   evaluation and, unlike standard ROC curves in the binary classification case,
   it does not represent every possible operating point configuration of the
   evaluated system. For example, a system with two possible classes (speech and
   drum) can be tuned to achieve 80% TP for speech and 70% TP for drum, but
   such an operating point is not precisely represented on the PSD-ROC curve.
   Hence, not all possible configurations of the given system are expected to lie
   on the curve. However, the summary of the performance and how it changes for
   each class is still represented in the PSD-ROC and its area (i.e. the PSDS).
   * The PSD-ROC curve is monotonically increasing. However, when `alpha_st` is
   not 0, this can no longer be guaranteed (cf. Equation 9 in the paper linked
   above).

## Installation
In order to install the `psds_eval` package:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/audioanalytic/psds_eval.git`
2. `cd psds_eval`
3. `pip install -Ue .`

## Running the tests
The tests can be run using pytest with:
> `pytest tests`

## Code Example
A code example is available within the package showing how to use the library
to calculate the PSDS of a system for a given dataset.

The dataset used in the example is the validation subset from the challenge
[DCASE-2019 Task 4](http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-large-scale-weakly-labeled-semi-supervised-sound-event-detection#audio-dataset).
For simplicity, ground truths and metadata are available within this
package under `examples/data`.

The baseline system provided in
[Task 4](http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-large-scale-weakly-labeled-semi-supervised-sound-event-detection#baseline-system)
does not support an adjustable output threshold out-of-the-box. Therefore it
was modified so that a different set of detections is produced for each chosen
threshold value.
Each detection set is saved and available in the data folder. The filenames
follow the convention: `baseline_<TH>.csv`, where TH = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0
represents the threshold value.

Once the `psds_eval` package is installed you may run the evaluation example using the
Python script from the examples folder like so:
```
$ python examples/run_psds.py
```
The script should output a PSD-Score value of **0.40867** and the plot below.

## Notebook on PSDS evaluation of DCASE2020 Task 4 baseline system
A Jupyter notebook has been created to show how PSDS can be used to extract
insights on a SED system performance. It also explains in more detail certain
key features of PSDS.

The notebook is available [here](./jupyter/psds.ipynb).

## FAQ
### What are all the PSDS parameters for?
One of the design principles behind `psds_eval` is *flexibility*.
In practice, the PSDS evaluation can adapt to any task constraints by
configuring the following three parameters (cf. Fig.2a article):

1. **Detection Tolerance Criterion threshold** (cf. Definition 2 article)
    * Controls how precise a system detection has to be with respect to all the
    ground truths of the same class that it intersects.

2. **Ground Truth intersection Criterion threshold** (cf. Definition 3 article)
    * Defines the amount of minimum overlap necessary to count a ground truth
    as correctly detected.

3. **Cross-Trigger Tolerance Criterion threshold** (cf. Definition 4 article)
    * Same as DTC, but applied to the system detections that intersect ground
    truths of other classes of interest for detection, as distinct from false
    alarms which donâ€™t intersect with any other label.

Moreover, the calculation of the PSDS of a system can be configured to take into
account several constraints:

- The importance of **cross-triggers** can be specified in the effective False
Positive Rate definition by the parameter `alpha_ct` (cf. Equation 6 article)

- The importance of **inter-class variability** is controlled in the definition of
the effective True Positive Ratio by the parameter `alpha_st` (cf. Equation 9 article)

- The maximum effective False Positive Rate at which the area under the PSD-ROC is
computed can be adjusted by the parameter `max_efpr`. This value is crucial because
it defines an upper bound for the mistakes a system can make in a unit of time.


**Important notes:**
- More than one detection can contribute to a single true positive (TP)
- Detections contributing to TPs are not considered for cross-trigger (CT) counts
- `alpha_st` must be a positive number

### Why are multiple operating points required?
We want to evaluate a system across a range of operating points in contrast with
more classic metrics (such as F-Score or Accuracy). This approach provides
an evaluation which is more generic and independent from the system's tuning.

### What is the minimum number of operating points required?
It depends on how the system behaves. We encourage the user to start with at
least 20 operating points and, based on how the PSD-ROC looks, more operating
points can be added to represent the system behaviour as accurately as possible.

### Is it possible to remove the operating points for a new system evaluation?
Yes, it is possible to remove all the previously added operating points by using
the function `PSDSEval.clear_all_operating_points`. The evaluator is then ready
to accept new operating points and compute a new evaluation.

**Important notes:**
- the function _only_ removes the stored operating points
- the dataset, defined by `PSDSEval.metadata` and `PSDSEval.ground_truth`, is
not modified
- the task definition, defined by the 3 thresholds (DTC, GTC and CTTC) stored in
`self.threshold`, is not modified

### What are the input requirements?
All the inputs must be a `pandas.DataFrame`. There are two table
formats:

#### 1. `detections` and `ground_truth` tables format
Column names are the same as those used in the DCASE evaluation.
Each row is defined by 4 values:
- `filename`, identifies the input audio file
- `onset` and `offset` are the *start* and *end* time (expressed in seconds) of
the event
- `event_label` is the name of the class the event belongs to

An example of ground truth table

|  filename | onset | offset | event\_label |
| --------: | ----: | -----: | -----------: |
|  test.wav |   2.0 |   20.0 |           c1 |
|  test.wav |  12.0 |   35.0 |           c2 |
|  test.wav |  42.0 |   47.0 |           c3 |
| test2.wav |   5.0 |   20.0 |           c1 |
| test2.wav |   5.0 |   30.0 |           c2 |
| test2.wav |  42.0 |   47.0 |           c3 |
| test3.wav |   5.0 |   18.0 |           c1 |
| test3.wav |  10.0 |   30.0 |           c2 |
| test3.wav |  42.0 |   48.0 |           c3 |

An example of detections table

| filename | onset | offset | event\_label |
| -------: | ----: | -----: | -----------: |
| test.wav |   0.0 |   19.0 |           c1 |
| test.wav |  40.0 |   45.0 |           c1 |
| test.wav |  11.0 |   25.0 |           c2 |
| test.wav |  27.0 |   30.0 |           c2 |
| test.wav |  32.0 |   41.5 |           c2 |
| test.wav |  38.0 |   48.0 |           c3 |

#### 2. `metadata` table format
Simply contains the duration (in seconds) for each file in the dataset:

|  filename | duration |
| --------: | -------: |
|  test.wav |     50.0 |
| test2.wav |     50.0 |
| test3.wav |     50.0 |

**Important notes**
- `metadata` and `ground_truth` tables must have the same unique values in the
"filename" column

### Is it possible to find an operating point which leads to the best F1-score?
The `psds_eval` package provides a function called
 `select_operating_points_per_class()` which can help find the operating
  points which best satisfy the requested criteria on TPR, FPR, eFPR or F
  -score for each class. Examples on how to use this function are provided
   in the [example script](./examples/run_psds.py) and the [jupyter notebook
   ](./jupyter/psds.ipynb).
